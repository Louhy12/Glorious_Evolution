                <p>
                    In recent years, the call for diversity representation has grown stronger in media.
                    Indeed, on the one hand, for marginalized groups, positive media representation can 
                    be meaningful as it helps them find role models with which they can identify as well 
                    as increase their self-esteem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, good diversity exposition through media can assist in reducing 
                    stereotypes of underrepresented groups, as well as increasing the empathy of tolerance 
                    for the people who are not concerned.
                </p>

                    We took a quick look at google trends for the terms ‘’woke’’ and  ‘’go woke, go broke’. 
                    We see that these terms mostly come from the USA, and that’s where interest for these terms is highest, followed closely by Anglo countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. However, the concept is not entirely confined to the Anglosphere, as some non English-Speaking countries such as Russia or France still have a fifth of  the US’s rate of research. The peak of the searches for ‘woke’ peaked in August 2024 but it has been in search bars since at least 2020. ‘go woke go broke’ hit its peak in August 2023.
                    It is therefore a contemporary question that is of interest worldwide.
