                <h3>Dataset introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The dataset behind this analysis comes from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, enriched with additional attributes for deeper insights. 
                    It includes over 42,000 movie plot summaries in addition to metadata like release dates, box office revenue, languages, and countries. 
                    At the character level, it includes details such as gender, age, height, and ethnicity. 
                    To further enhance the analysis, we’ve added a new feature: "Actor Country of Origin," enabling a closer look at the representation of foreign actors in film.
                </p>
                <h3>What attributes could define diversity in films?</h3>
                <p>
                    Diversity in this context refers to variations in actors' attributes, including gender, ethnicity, age at the movie's release and height. 
                    While exploring traits like sexual orientation would have been insightful, this information isn’t available in the dataset. 
                    To track how diversity has evolved over time, we developed a diversity score, a metric that captures variation in actors' characteristics over a specific period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our analysis focuses on several key attributes:
                    <li>Gender</li>
                    <li>Ethnicity</li>
                    <li>Age</li>
                    <li>Height</li>
                    <li>Proportion of Foreign Actors</li>
                </p>
                <h3>How is the diversity score computed?</h3>
                <p>
                    To calculate the diversity scores, we took a comprehensive approach, considering the multiple forms of diversity. 
                    For gender, a simple formula is used: 1− ∣ Pmen−Pwomen ∣ , which captures the balance between the proportions of men and women in the cast. 
                    For age and height, we categorize individuals by age decades and height, then apply <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.109.064411" target="_blank">Simpson’s Diversity Index</a> to measure how varied these distributions were. This same index was applied to ethnicity, as it effectively measures the likelihood that two randomly selected individuals belong to different groups.

                <p>
                    In order to avoid generalizing a whole country’s performance based on a few movies, we decided for every time period to highlight the boundaries of countries that had produced two movies or less in the decade. 
                    Therefore, we know that the results are mostly robust for the countries which are not outlined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The maps before 1975 for this period show a concentration of movies produced in  Western Europe and North America. This is due to historical factors as other parts of the world such as Africa, Asia and Latin America were impoverished, colonized or under communist regimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 1975, we can see more regions join the producing of movies such as South Africa, North Africa, East Asia, and Oceania. This can be explained by the swift economic rise of the Asia Pacific during that period, as well as the early risers following decolonization. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, after the 1990s, we observe a truly globalized production with Eastern European countries and Russia joining in, Latin America and South East Asia. This is probably due to the fall of dictatorships and rising prosperity within these regions. Therefore, we notice that the producer countries’ diversity has definitely increased.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of ethnicity scores, we see that Europe is slightly more ethnically diverse than North America(0.6 vs 0.35). After 1975, we see America catching up and diverse new players such as South Africa, Tunisia, Australia and Norway with high scores of around 0.7. We see even more high performers join in like  Indonesia, the Scandinavian countries and Colombia.
                    We see that the global increase comes from the new players but also the old players increasing their score as we see that Europe and North America became a bit more diverse.For foreign actor proportion, we notice that most of the world except for East Asia and South East Asia seems to stagnate.
                    We observe a similar trend for gender diversity where the old Western world increases its scores while some new players like Russia and Morocco came in with more depictions of women in fiction. This trend also happened for age diversity and height diversity with Northern Europe being a world leader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the overall diversity, we definitely make an observation. Not only are more countries making movies, but each individual countries tend to use a more diverse cast.

                <p>
                    A first idea of how diversity has evolved over time was provided by geographical maps. 
                    However, we aimed to conduct a causal analysis of how society and politics have shaped and influenced the development of diversity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is interesting to observe how diversity scores have evolved over time, leading us to question whether the shifts in diversity trends are influenced by specific political, social, or historical events. 
                     By attempting to fit the data and extract a general predictive pattern using a third-degree polynomial regression, which yielded the most promising results in this case, we acknowledge that the fit is approximative. 
                    However, the focus is on identifying potential points where the trend changes, making this model adequate, even if not fully satisfying. 
                    Analyzing the critical points of the diversity trends over the years helps identify key changes, such as peaks, or turning points, which provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics and patterns of the data.

                <p>
                    In particular we observed that the period ranging from 1950 to 1970 is touched by a change in the trend passing from a decreasing to an increase in the overall diversity. 
                    On the contrary, from 2000 to  2010 a slight decrease is observed, but we can’t draw any significant conclusion since we miss information about the years following 2010, which could change the trend of the prediction. 
                    These years until nowadays have in fact a very strong impact on the diversity representation in films. 
                    It can be observed that, although the R-scores indicate that predicting the trend is challenging, a general pattern emerges that can be correlated with specific historical events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We observed a notable shift in the trend during the decade from 1950 to 1970, where the overall diversity began to increase after a period of decline. 
                    In contrast, between 2000 and 2010, we observed a slight decrease in diversity. 
                    However, this trend remains uncertain, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn due to the lack of data for the years following 2010, which could significantly alter the prediction.

                            The <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/368657?origin=crossref" target="_blank">Civil Rights Movement</a> in the United States played a significant role in pushing for equal rights and social justice for African Americans. 
                            As the civil rights movement achieved important victories, the contestment of segregation and racial discrimination increased allowing broader cultural and political changes. 
                            Black representation in American society increased, spreading the ideologies and creating a network of activists who would actively press for more inclusive representations and shaping other movements, such as those fighting for women’s rights.

                            The term <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/3539" target="_blank">“New Hollywood”</a> refers to a period of transformation in American cinema that emerged in the late 1960s, following the collapse of the traditional studio system and therefore declining box office sales. 
                            Since television was the dominant form of entertainment, Hollywood executives opened the doors to new generations of filmmakers, who, inspired by European experimental films, introduced a more realistic, nuanced and artistic approach to storytelling.

                            Cinema quickly became a platform for the expression and exploration of societal issues. 
                            This shift in filmmaking significantly enhanced the diversity of representation in films by addressing topics such as social issues, gender, and class. 
                            “The Leaning Treee” (1969) directed by Gordon Parks Sr., is a significant reflection of the racial challenges presented in the film industry during the “New Hollywood” era.

                            The post-World War II era was marked by significant waves of immigration, resulting in increasingly societal diversity. Films began to mirror these societal changes, and the concept of global cinema started to take shape. 
                            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-film" target="_blank">Post-war film industries</a>, such as Italian cinema, served as a source of inspiration for other nations striving to rebuild both physically and economically after the war. 
                            Italian Neorealism emerged during this period, offering a strong contrast to pre-war cinema that often focused on censored television and idealized portrayals of society. 
                            Films like Umberto D. (1952), included in the dataset, exemplify this movement, which was pioneered by Vittorio De Sica, one of the three major directors of Italian Neorealism.

                    Given these crucial events, it is not surprising to observe an increase in diversity representation within the film industry during this period reflected in the dataset analyzed.
